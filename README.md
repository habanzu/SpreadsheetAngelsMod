# SpreadsheetAngelsMod
A little Python Project that gets data from the lua files in Angels Mod (a mod for Factorio) and puts them into a
Excel Spreadsheet. I made it to build the optimal production chains, especially for Angel's Petrochem.

It's just a hobby project I made in my free time and still needs a lot of polishing, but I stopped playing Factorio.
If someone is interested i would finish it.
